## Roles and responsibilities

### 1. Mobile Engineer (iOS/Android)
**Responsibilities**: Develops and maintains the customer-facing mobile applications. They implement new features, ensure the app performs well across different devices and OS versions, fix bugs, and collaborate with designers to implement intuitive UIs. They also manage the release process to App Store and Google Play.

### 2. Backend Engineer (High Load/Microservices)
**Responsibilities**: Builds and maintains the server-side logic, APIs, and databases that power the platform. They design microservices, optimize code for high concurrency and low latency, ensure data consistency, and integrate with third-party services (like payment gateways).

### 3. Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) or DevOps 
**Responsibilities**: Ensures the reliability, scalability, and availability of production systems. They build automation for deployment (CI/CD), monitor system health (`Grafana`/`Prometheus`), handle incident response, and conduct post-mortems. They bridge the gap between development and operations.

### 4. QA Engineer (Automation)
**Responsibilities**: Designs and writes automated test scripts to verify software quality. They create test plans, execute regression tests, report defects, and integrate automated tests into the build pipeline to prevent bugs from reaching production.

### 5. Product Manager
**Responsibilities**: Defines the product vision, strategy, and roadmap. They act as the voice of the customer, gathering requirements, prioritizing features for the engineering team, analyzing metrics to measure success, and coordinating launches across different teams.

- **Basic Application Architecture**: Understanding how clients, servers, and databases interact (HTTP, REST, JSON).
- **Problem Solving**: Analytical thinking to break down complex issues into manageable solutions.
- **English Language**: Proficiency in reading technical documentation and communicating in international environments.
- **Terminal/Command Line**: Basic familiarity with shell commands for navigating and querying system state.
